# Introduction
In the city of Aeropolis, delivery drones are essential for transporting goods quickly and efficiently. However, their cargo capacity (Cargo_Capacity_kg) can be affected by many factors, like weather conditions, terrain type, and the quality of their equipment. The primary aim of this project is to build and train a model that predicts the cargo capacity of drones based on multiple environmental and operational factors. These implemented changes would help us to improve delivery efficiency and gain a deeper understanding of impacts of drone performance.

# Results
## Main Findings

The final results indicate that the Linear Regression model achieved the best performance among the models tested. It demonstrated the highest RÂ² score of **0.70** and the lowest RMSE of **0.88** on the test set. These results suggest that the Linear Regression model provides a simple yet effective approach to predicting drone cargo capacity.

From the Linear Regression model, we analyzed the most influential features impacting cargo capacity. The analysis revealed the following key factors:

1. **Vertical_Landing_Supported**: This feature shows a strong positive impact, indicating drones with vertical landing capability can carry more cargo.
2. **Flight_Duration_Minutes**: A negative coefficient suggests that longer flight durations reduce the cargo capacity, likely due to energy constraints.
3. **Market_Region_North**: This feature positively influences cargo capacity, potentially reflecting favorable operational conditions in this region.

These findings highlight the critical operational and environmental factors that influence drone performance, providing actionable insights for optimizing cargo capacity.
