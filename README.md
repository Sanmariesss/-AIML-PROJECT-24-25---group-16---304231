# Introduction
In the city of Aeropolis, delivery drones are essential for transporting goods quickly and efficiently. However, their cargo capacity (Cargo_Capacity_kg) can be affected by many factors, like weather conditions, terrain type, and the quality of their equipment. The primary aim of this project is to build and train a model that predicts the cargo capacity of drones based on multiple environmental and operational factors. These implemented changes would help us to improve delivery efficiency and gain a deeper understanding of impacts of drone performance.
